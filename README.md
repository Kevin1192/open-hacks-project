We worked as a group of four to build this web application under 24 hours constraint. We conceived this idea during our discussion via Zoom and decided to use React for the front-end and Firebase for the logic.


## Contribution

My contributions are

1. the Landing page UI and

2. the Chat Room functionality.


For the landing page UI, I used reusable components from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) library to create the skeleton.

The Chat Room functionality is implemented using React and firebase API.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot from this hackathon and would continue learning software development to build better applications.
